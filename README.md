# Chat Sound Alerts

## What does this addon do.

This addon will play a sound of your choice (from a list of pre-selected in-game sounds) for a variety of events and condition in the in-game chat. Different sounds can be selected for different events individually to make it easier to distinguish one from another.

Current events on which you can receive an alert:
* Any guild messages (including officer messages).
* Per zone messages (including language-specific).
* Whispers / tells / says / yells / emotes (including monster).
* Group / party / leader messages.

Conditions you can select:
* In-combat or out-of-combat.
* In AvA zone or out-of-AvA.
* Force whisper or yell notification.
* Force party leader notifications.
* Frequency of notification.

Other features:
* Excludes yourself from notifications.
* Can synchronize settings with "Simple Chat Bubbles" addon.

For any sounds that are not available but you think are suitable/neede for chat message alerts - let me know which one you want to have to be added to the lists! For now I have just grabbed a list of sounds that I have found most suitable to my taste, it does not mean that there are no other good alert sounds in game :). 

## How do I configure it?

You can find the settings in Addon Settings -> Chat Sound Alerts. In the Chat Sound Alerts section you will find everything you need precisely configure and fine tune the addon to your individual needs. It is pretty straight forward and the tooltips on mouse overs has even more detailed information.

## Chat commands.

The following commands are supported in chat window:
* **/mute** - mutes all sound notifications.
* **/unmute** - un-mutes previously muted notifications.

## Group leader chat notification.

Unique feature that I have "spyed" for awesome [The Master's Voice](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1113-TheMastersVoice.html) addon, all credits for this idea does to HomoPuerRobustus. The addon can play a dedicated sound alert whenever the group leader says something in chat so you don't miss important messages in the heat of battle. Extremely useful feature IMHO.
 
## What's up next?

* Add "conversation notification" feature.
* Allow to specify a blacklist of players you don't want it to make a notification for.
* Add feature "alert trigger on custom words/phrases if said in chat".
* Add feature "alert when a contact comes online/offline".
* Add feature "alert on messages from contacts".
* Add feature "alert when your name said in chat".
* Allow you to individually choose which contacts play a sound or not.

## Credits.

* sirinsidiator and Seerah for LibAddonMenu-2.0 - so much time saved!
* HomoPuerRobustus for "The Master's Voice" - that was my starting point and inspiration!
